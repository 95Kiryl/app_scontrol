# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project provides an SPA application written using the following technologies: React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit. There are three pages: main, tasks, contacts. Routing is done using react-router. The contacts page contains a feedback form, the data is output to the console in JSON format. On the task page there is a table that displays information: task id, name, status (selected from the drop-down list), date, as well as buttons for deleting and editing tasks. The table implements functionality: adding a new task, deleting tasks and editing existing ones. All data entered into the table is stored in LocalStorage. The application is responsive for desktop and mobile phones.
To run the application locally, download the archive from the GitHub repository to your computer. Open the project in a code editor and install the node-modules dependencies into the project folder using the npm install command. After installing the dependencies, run the application using the npm start command.
